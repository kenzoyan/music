# Django + React

### Practice project

- Day 1 : set up project; intergration of Django & React
- Day 2 : Using material UI; Post request; create room detail(handle url params in react)
- Day 3 : room join page; room detail; router in pages with navigate;
- Day 4 :  Updpate Room info ; Connect Spotify web API;
- Day 5 : get current song info; pause/play; vote to skip

- Problem:  functional based structure may be better, change to hooks later
